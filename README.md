# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

### Purpose of this analysis.

In response to the school board finding evidence of academic dishonesty in the students_complete.csv file, we are tasked with cleaning and summarizing the data. Because the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders were altered, we must replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact to uphold state-testing standards. Once the math and reading scores are replaced, the school district analysis can be repeated with the newly cleaned data to find how these changes affected the overall analysis.
